        <p>The FASTER Scale app is an automated, cloud-based tool based on the addiction recovery worksheet created by Michael Dye.</p>
        <p>The worksheet helps to identify anxiety before a relapse.  It's a remarkable system that helps people on their journey through recovery.</p>

        <p>This is a quick app I made to demonstrate some of the components included in the Angular-Material library.  I particularly like the toast feature, the fab buttons, and the Side Navigation component.  Angular Material is more than a simple library.  It includes services as well as a layout and grid system that I have implemented in this app as well.  For more information about Angular-Material, check out my slide deck <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cRY7x3hgDANZMslfJ-9ImD7Yw2-gAD_aCXQYlFXC7AM/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a></p>
