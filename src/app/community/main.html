        <h1>The Nascent Life of a Directive</h1>
        <p class="date">Date: June 9, 2015</p>
        <p>During an "Intro to Angular" event at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/RockyMountainAngularJS/events/222404030/">Rocky Mountain AngularJS</a>, I gave this talk about the basics of directives.  The talk starts by building the smallest directive possible.  Then, definition is progressively added to the directive, followed by an explanation of what functionality was gained.</p>

        <p>Angular Material is more than just a UI component library.  It includes its own layout and grid system and introduces dynamic theming.  Find out more from this slidedeck I've put together for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-DC/events/219621501/">Washington DC</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Boston/events/220442286/">Boston</a> Angular Meetups.</p>
