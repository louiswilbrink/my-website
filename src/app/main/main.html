      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am a full stack JavaScript engineer, building Angular apps for almost two years.  I focus on listening to new ideas, and building fast, responsive web and native apps.  Currently, I use Node on the server, along with MongoDB, MySql and Firebase for a database.  Iâ€™m a life-long learner and am always trying new frameworks and libraries.  Also, I love volleyball and basketball.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>I have a degree in Electrical Engineering and worked for Raytheon for 7 years before transitioning into application development.  I got my start by enrolling in a web development fundamentals course at Harvard Extension School and joining a startup job to learn the ropes.  Then I had the chance to work with a world class software team at <a href="http://www.mak.com">VT MAK</a> where I became a Senior Software Engineer.  I am now a full time consultant and regularly participate in technology meetups.</p>
