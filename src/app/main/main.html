        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I am a full stack JavaScript engineer, building Angular apps for almost two years.  I like learning new technologies and trying new frameworks and libraries.  What excites me most is building a new prototype and taking care of everything from UI to DevOps.</p>
        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>I have a degree in Electrical Engineering and worked for Raytheon for 7 years before transitioning into application development.  I got my start by taking a web development fundamentals course at Harvard Extension School and taking an $8/hour startup job (benefits: false).  Then I had the chance to work with a world class software team at VT MAK where I became a Senior Software Engineer.  I transitioned from there to embrace full time contracting and participating in the technology community.</p>
