        <p class="date">Date: July 1, 2015</p>
        <p>The <code>this</code> keyword in JavaScript can be pretty confusing.  It's name itself is vague and the value of <code>this</code> can change in different conditions.  But understanding <code>this</code> provides powerful functionality, and you'll see it in many codebases, so it's worth learning the definition and rules.</p>

        <p>Highcharts is a powerful graphing library that is particularly good for financial tech apps. The API reference is very well organized and detailed and the number of charts they offer make it a competitive offering versus D3. While it's not free, it's well worth the investment.</p>

        <p>I've been working with SailsJS to increase my development speed.  I spent a morning getting a simple REST API working and am summarizing my efforts so that it takes a developer after me only 10 minutes to get something up and running.</p>

        <p>Last year, Google announced Material Design and began to implement this design philosophy in all of its apps.  If you use Google Inbox or Maps, you've already seen what a Material Design app looks and feels like.</p>
        <p>Angular Material brings these UI components into the Angular world.  I've written two apps using only Angular-Material components and have been pleased with the results: the apps are simple and intuitive.  Plus, you get to leverage the fact that your users (if they use Google Apps) will already be familiar with the interactive components on the page</p>
