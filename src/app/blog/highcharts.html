        <h1>Getting Started with Highcharts and Angular</h1>
        <p class="date">Date: June 1, 2015</p>
        <p>Highcharts is a powerful graphing library that is particularly good for financial tech apps.  The <a href="http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts">API reference</a> is very well organized and detailed and the number of charts they offer make it a competitive offering versus D3.  While it's not free, it's well worth the investment.</p>
        <p>There is also an Angular module for Highcharts, called <a href="https://github.com/pablojim/highcharts-ng">highcharts-ng</a>, which wraps Highcharts into directives.  Using this module allows you to source all of your data within the Angular ecosystem, and hand it off to a highchart directive.  It's very helpful and straight-forward, however I didn't find a lot of examples on how to create many of the charts on the <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/demo">Highcharts Demo</a> page.  I've summarized a few of them in case other developers are experiencing this too.</p>
        <p>Here's the setup:</p>
        <p>Install the necessary bower packages using the following commands:</p>
        <gist id="bb7240bdfbd9a2d73ff3"></gist>
        <p>Your <code>bower.json</code> file should look like this:</p>
        <gist id="be58444b99f186c6aed8"></gist>
        <p>Then include these resources in your <code>index.html</code> file:</p>
        <gist id="c48eb57bb4ef342b5320"></gist>
        <p>Notice that <code>highcharts-more.js</code> is included as well.  This will give you access to a few more chart types</p>
        <h2>Wind Rose</h2>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/louiswilbrink-blog/highcharts/highcharts-3.png"/>
        <p>Each graph example will consist of a simple controller and view.  In the view, you'll include the Highcharts element directive, and specify a <code>$scope</code> variable for its config attribute.  Here's the entire view:</p>
        <gist id="6b4f9e724be602b937d9"></gist>
        <p>In the controller, the following <code>$scope</code> values will draw the wind rose graph:</p>
