        <h1>Using SendGrid to Power Your Website's Email Form</h1>
        <p class="date">Date: June 5, 2015</p>
        <p>Every site needs an email solution, whether it's to support a web app, or to launch a marketing campaign.  I chose to learn and invest in <a href="http://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a> because I heard that they took care of thousands of nuance problems with emailing and just got emails to their destinations.  I also loved the idea that they were an <strong>API</strong> company.  This communicated to me that their platform was lean and wouldn't restrict the developer, and that's exactly what I've found so far.  Read on to see how to quickly get started with <a href="http://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a>, and how to use it to power your website's email form.
